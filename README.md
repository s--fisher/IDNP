# IDNP
# The IDNP (Instantaneous Data Networking Protocol) is a networking protocol designed to transmit data across large distances, using a 3D disk space to store and transmit data. The protocol works by mapping virtual addresses to physical locations on the disk, and using a set of algorithms to encrypt and decrypt the data being transmitted.

# In more technical terms, the IDNP uses a 64-bit virtual address space and 64-bit words to represent data, and uses a 65 petabyte disk to store the data. Users can create IDNP networks using a 4 petabyte disk, and quest up to 3 petabytes of data on the network. The protocol uses TGHC (Timing Graphics Human Computing) to generate random numbers that are used to encrypt and decrypt data transmissions.

# The IDNP Makefile is a script that compiles the IDNP protocol, and allows it to be executed on a given system. The Makefile specifies the various components of the protocol, including the main IDNP program, as well as various libraries and other dependencies required for the protocol to run.

# Overall, the IDNP is a powerful and innovative networking protocol that offers many advantages over traditional networking protocols, particularly for transmitting large amounts of data across vast distances.

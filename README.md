# IDNP
# The IDNP (Instantaneous Data Networking Protocol) is a networking protocol designed to transmit data across large distances, using a 3D disk space to store and transmit data. The protocol works by mapping virtual addresses to physical locations on the disk, and using a set of algorithms to encrypt and decrypt the data being transmitted.

# In more technical terms, the IDNP uses a 64-bit virtual address space and 64-bit words to represent data, and uses a 65 petabyte disk to store the data. Users can create IDNP networks using a 4 petabyte disk, and quest up to 3 petabytes of data on the network. The protocol uses TGHC (Timing Graphics Human Computing) to generate random numbers that are used to encrypt and decrypt data transmissions.

# The IDNP Makefile is a script that compiles the IDNP protocol, and allows it to be executed on a given system. The Makefile specifies the various components of the protocol, including the main IDNP program, as well as various libraries and other dependencies required for the protocol to run.

# Overall, the IDNP is a powerful and innovative networking protocol that offers many advantages over traditional networking protocols, particularly for transmitting large amounts of data across vast distances.

#Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

#Install the necessary dependencies. IDNP requires Scapy and PyShark packages to be installed. You can install them using pip by running the following command:

# Copy code
# pip install scapy pyshark
# Download the IDNP package from the GitHub repository: https://github.com/s--fisher/IDNP

# Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file.

# Navigate to the extracted directory using the command line.

# Run the following command to install IDNP:

# # Install dependencies
sudo apt-get install libsf-dev

# Compile the software
make

# Copy the executable and required files
sudo cp idnp /usr/local/bin/
sudo cp -R sf_library: /usr/local/include/

# Create configuration files and directories
sudo mkdir /etc/idnp
sudo cp idnp.conf /etc/idnp/

# Install systemd service
sudo cp idnp.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable idnp.service
sudo systemctl start idnp.service

# Copy code
# python setup.py install
# After completing these steps, IDNP should be installed on your system and ready to use.

# You can verify that IDNP is installed correctly by running the import idnp command in a Python shell. If no error occurs, then the package is installed correctly.
